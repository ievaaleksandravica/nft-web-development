                    <p class="bold">What are NFTs?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art</li>
                        <li>NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm</li>
                        <li>Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to a new crypto-audience</li>
                        <li>And celebrities are joining in as they spot a new opportunity to connect with fans. But digital art is only one way to use NFTs</li>
                        <li>Really they can be used to represent ownership of any unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Interesting note</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have minted Cambell's Soup as NFT</li>
                        <li>It's only a matter of time before Kanye puts a run of Yeezys on Ethereum</li>
                        <li>And one day owning your car might be proved with an NFT</li>

                <h3 >Technically Defining What is An NFT</h3>
                <div class="content-details">
                    <p class="bold">Definition of NFT</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NFT stands for non-fungible token.</li>
                        <li>Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer</li>
                        <li>These things are not interchangable for other items because they have unique properties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Fungible items</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fungible items, on the other hand, can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties</li>
                        <li>For example, ETH or dollars are fungible, because 1 ETH / 1 USD is exchangable for another 1 ETH / 1 USD</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="bold">The Internet of Assets - comparison</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: NFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the same. <u>Internet Today</u>: A copy of file, like an .mp3 or .jpg is the same as original</li>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: Every NFT must have an owner and this is of public record and easy for anyone to verify. <u>Internet Today</u>: Ownership records of digital items are stored on servers controlled by institutions. You must take their word for it</li>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: NFTs are compatible with anything built using Ethereum. An NFT ticket for an event can be traded on every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely different NFT. You could trade a piece of art for a ticket <u>Internet Today</u>: Companies with digital items must build their own infrastracture. For example, an app that issues digital tickets for events would have to build their own ticket exchange</li>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: Content creators can sell their work anywhere and can access a global market <u>Internet Today</u>: Creators rely on the infrastructure and distribution platforms they use. These are often subject to terms of use and geographical restrictions</li>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: Creators can retain ownership rights ower their own work, and claim resale royalties directly <u>Internet Today</u>: Platforms, such as music streaming services, retain the majority of profits from sales.</li>
                        <li><u>An NFT internet</u>: Items can be used in surprising ways. For example, you can use digital artwork as collateral in a decentralised loan

                <div class="content-details">
                     <p class="bold">Smart Contracts</p>  
                     <ul>
                         <li>Smart contract languages like Solidity cannot be executed by EVM directly</li>
                         <li>Instead, they are compiled to low-level machine instructions (called <u>opcodes</u></li>
                         <li>If you go to <a href="https://www.ethervm.io">EtherVM</a> you can read up on all the Virtual Machine opcodes</li>
                         
                     </ul>     
                     <p class="bold">Opcodes</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Smart Contracts are just like regular accounts, except they run EVM bytecode when receiving a transaction, allowing them to perform calculations and further transactions</li>
                        <li>Each opcode is encoded as one byte, except for the <u>PUSH</u> opcodes, which take a immediate value</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p class="bold">Storage</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Storage is a persistent associative map, with <u>uint256</u>s as keys and <u>uint256</u>s as values</li>
                         <li>All contract fields and mappings are saved in storage</li>
                         <li>Storage fields can be inspected using <u>web3.eth.getStorageAt(addtess, key)</u></li>

            <h3>How Contract Storage Works With Ethereum Smart Contracts</h3>
                <div class="content-details">
                    <p class="bold">High Level vs Low Level Languages</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower-level programming languages often use a <u>stack</u> to pass values to functions</li>
                        <li>The EVM uses a <u>256-bit register stack</u> from which the most recent 16 items can be accessed or manipulated at once.</li>
                        <li>In total, the stack can only hold <u>1024</u> items</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Byte codes</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because of these limitations, complicated opcodes instead use <u>contract memory</u> to retrieve or pass data</li>
                        <li>Contract storage essentially acts as a public database, from which values can be read externally without having to send a transaction to contract (no fees!)</li>
                        <li>However, writing to storage is very expensive (as much as 6000x) to writing in memory</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Under the hood, EVM uses a set of instructions (called <u>opcodes</u>) to execute specific tasks</li>
                        <li>There are over 100 opcodes. This means the EVM is able to compute (almost) anything, given enough resources</li>
                        <li>Because opcodes are one byte, there can only be a maximum of 256 opcodes</li>

                <ul>
